## **Â¡Optimizing laser cutting with my new project!**

While I am not yet part of a technology company, I like to contribute my grain of sand to the metallurgy company where I work. For this reason, I am developing an app to control the status of metal parts in real time during the laser cutting process.



## **How does it work?**

1. The app connects to the SQL Server database created by the Lantek Expert cutting software.
2. I use a REST API created with Java Spring Boot to obtain real-time information about each part.

This is a great project that has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the laser cutting process. The use of a real-time data connection and a REST API will make it possible to monitor the status of each part in real time, which will help to identify and prevent problems before they occur.

For now, I am developing the basic logic to be able to obtain the information from the database in JSON format. Next step is the devolopment of the interface.

**I will keep updating the progress!**

## Introduction

On the [previous post](http://fjcon.github.io/portfolio/post/api-rest-cutting) I wrote about an API Rest development using Java with Spring boot Framework which provides information from and SQL Server database created by a laser cutting software.

As you know, I've been working hard on this app for a while, and I'm happy to announce that I now have a considerable portion of the API finished.

## Frontend development

I have developed some screens that display crucial information for the cutting process, such as:

* Customers: View a complete list of customers for whom outages are being made.
* Sheet thicknesses: Shows the sheet thicknesses scheduled to be cut by the equipment, broken down by client.
* Nests: Presents a detailed view of each nest, including the pieces it contains.
* Pieces per nest: Provides specific information about each piece within a nest.

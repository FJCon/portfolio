## Introduction
Recently, I had the opportunity to work with a metallurgical company specializing in stainless steel to develop their new website. 
They wanted to create a digital identity that would help them attract more clients.


## Development
The project came about spontaneously, and I was involved from the very beginning:
- Advised on hosting selection
- Designed and developed the site using WordPress
- Wrote all the content based on available information, ensuring clear and professional communication of the companyâ€™s services.

I decided to use WordPress for website development to reduce both delivery time and costs for the client.
Development took approximately a week, and I was only provided with basic information and a few images.

II took advantage of artificial intelligence tools to create the cover image for the home page and to improve the quality of other images.

Additionally, I used my previous experience as a metalworking company employee to write some of the content for the page about the processes and services my client offers.

## Conclusion

It was an interesting challenge, especially due to the limited initial documentation, but that also made it more motivating. Now, the client has a solid and functional online presence.

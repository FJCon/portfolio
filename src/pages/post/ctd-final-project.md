They can also access detailed information about destinations and accommodation options, 
and view their travel history to make new reservations based on previous trips.

## My Role in the Project

I worked as a fullstack developer, working on both the frontend and backend of the application.

* **Frontend:**
    * I implemented the user interface using React, creating reusable components and a fluid and intuitive user experience.
    * I made sure the application was responsive and adaptable to different devices.
* **Backend:**
    * I worked on the backend development using Java Spring Boot, creating an API for managing users, roles, reservations, etc.
    * I implemented the business logic for the application, including data validation, transaction management, and communication with the database.

## Conclusions

The development of this travel booking application was a challenging but rewarding experience. 
It allowed us to work as a team, apply our technical knowledge, and create a functional and attractive application. 
This project has prepared us to face future challenges in the field of programming.
